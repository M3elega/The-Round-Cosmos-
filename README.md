# The Round Cosmos

### A coherent framework for meta-cosmology  
**Author:** M. Belega  

---

## 🌌 Overview
*The Round Cosmos* is an open theoretical framework exploring the cyclical structure of the Universe, the nature of dark and visible matter, and the informational realignment of space-time.  
It introduces concepts such as the **Temporal Kernel K(t – t′)**, **Cosmological Memory**, and the **V.A.T.R.A. phase converter**, providing a bridge between classical relativistic physics and coherent field models.

## 🧭 Philosophy
> “We do not possess time; we move through the time of the Universe.”  
> — M. Belega  

The project treats time as a universal property rather than a local coordinate of the observer. Observers, matter, and energy are temporary manifestations within the continuous realignment of the cosmic field.
